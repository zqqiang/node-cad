//!
//! - Implementation of View Selector for dynamic selection
//! in Views from V3d.
//!
//! - Implementation of Tool class to decompose 3D BRep Objects
//! into sensitive Primitives for every desired mode of selection
//! (selection of vertex,edges,wires,faces,...)
//!
//! -  Implementation of dedicated Sensitives Entities:
//! Text for 2D Views (linked to Specific 2D projectors.)
